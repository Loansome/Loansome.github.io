									<h3 class="major">Who Am I?</h3>
									<p>Hello! I'm Gabriel, and I am a combat designer, programmer, and 3D animator. I have an associates degree in computer science and a bachelor's in ATEC (Arts, Technology, and Emmerging Communication), a degree at UTD designed for making games and animations come to life.</p>

									<p>Like anyone else in this field, I love all things game dev and animation. I grew up playing games like Halo, Kingdom Hearts, and Super Mario Galaxy, and watching things like WALL-E, Gurren Lagann, and RWBY. Seeing how media affects you on such a personal level is something I love about the medium, and nothing hits like that 30 second gameplay loop of your favorite game, or seeing a well-crafted shot in a movie or TV series that you rewatch over and over again.</p>

									<p>As for my specialties, I have been driven to learn as much as I can, and I've since grown a passion for game/combat design, programming, and 3D animation, as well as various technical animation techniques. Making a game that keeps the player engaged and stuck in that loop and hooking audiences to stay attached and immersed and thinking about the worlds you create is a specific kind of joy that I love to see and foster.</p>

									<p>I have learned and worked extensively in various software such as Maya, Unity, and Houdini, as well as different coding languages like C++, C#, and Javascript, but my current daily loves are with Blender and Unreal for making the things I am right now. I am confident in my ability to adapt and learn new softwares and skills, however, and am always looking for ways to challenge myself and become a better person, both in and out of media creation.</p>
