									<h2 class="major">Chronostasis</h2>
									<p>Chronostasis is a character action game where you can fight enemies in waves using a scythe and time-stopping powers. <br /><br />
										You can download the game <a href="http://chronostasisgame.com">here at chronostasisgame.com</a>!</p>

									<video height="auto" width="100%" controls muted>

									</video>
										<br/>
										(This game is a WIP. The game as you see it now (and as described below) is running on more custom-built code, but is currently being reworked to support the Gameplay Ability System,
										and fix some underlying quirks to make it easier to develop long-term.)<br /><br />
									<br /><br />

										<br />
										<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="../../images/Bayonetta Death Screen.png" alt="" />(Bayonetta death screen, punishes you for dying)</span>
											When making Chronostasis, I wanted the combat to play close to a character action game (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, etc) 
											where players start out not knowing the mechanics and losing a few fights here and there, to eventually come out styling on their foes. 
											Although, a lot of these games tend to have issues with their mechanics. Things like combo meters and grading systems could be rewarding for high end play, 
											though for lower skilled players or for those just getting to grips with the game, it can be a pain to deal with.
										</p>

										<p>
											The game that I think handles these aspects best that I took the most inspiration from, is Kingdom Hearts 2.
											The game has a lot to support both play styles, as
											players that are new to the game can equip whatever they want and mash attack, while more experienced players will knowingly keeping track of everything to attack their best.
											Enemies also play a role, asking players to wait for a window to stagger them. After a few hits, the enemy will break out of stagger, and the combat loops back around.
											There's a lot of nuance to the combat system that I'm skipping over, but these are the basics that I wanted to carry over for Chronostasis.
										</p>

										<br />

										<h3>Designing and Creating Chronostasis</h3>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="../../images/Chronostasis Environment Concept.png" alt="" />(Concept art of the environment)</span>
											Chronostasis as you see it was developed from scratch within a 1 year time limit. While the game has more features planned, the build that you see here is more focused on combat.
											Some features of combat did have to be stripped down, such as extra attacks or weapons, although the core does still exist within this vertical slice.
											My main goals for the smaller-scaled Chronostasis build were to have the controls and combat feel simple yet deep, for players and enemies to have a back and forth with each other,
											for the game to remain engaging for the duration of their play session, and ultimately to give players a taste of the game before moving to something higher scoped.
										</p>

										<p>
											For these goals, I set out to have each gameplay role be compressed into their own respective button, and for the main loop to be blocking enemies and punishing their attacks.
											While we were unable to make a more complete level with scripted events, the next best thing to make that encouraged a sense of progression and tension building was a wave-based mode.
											And if things got too tense for players, they could stop time for a moment of reprieve against the enemy assault and fit in some damage.

											<details><summary><h2 class="major" style="display:inline-block">1. Control Scheme</h2></summary>
											<p>This section goes over the simplicity of controls, and a bit about the base gameplay.</p>
											<br />
											<h3>Explanation</h3>

											<p>
												For Chronostasis, the goal for the control scheme was to make sure controls were consistent between both keyboard and gamepad, and making things as easy and accessible as possible.
												With gamepads having less buttons overall, I spent some time focusing on gamepad over keyboard and mouse controls, but still made sure both were seamless and enjoyable experiences.
											</p>
											<p>
												This is the control scheme I came up with for gamepad users:
												<img height="auto" width="100%" src="../../images/chronostasis controller reference.png" alt="" />
											</p>
											<p>
												For keyboard and mouse, WASD, the mouse, and space are move, look, and jump respectively, as any other PC game would.
												<br />
												Attack is set to left mouse click, defense options set to both right click and shift, Chronostasis set to F, and interact set to E.
											</p>

											<p>
												When looking at these controls at a glance, every button has a role to fill, so players can easily find the actions that they want to use without getting confused or overwhelmed with options.
												By handling the controls this way, it makes it easier for new players to jump in and enjoy the game even if they might not understand the nuance, while still leaving room for players to experiment.
												This also pushes the game away from requiring players to have a certain level of mechanical skill like a fighting game, and instead lets them focus on the battle in front of them.
											</p>
											<p>
												To compress attack and defense mechanics to singular buttons, the more specific actions you can use with each are determined by context. What does this mean?
												For attacks, you can trigger a combo chain with more deadly attacks if you continue to press the attack button, or choose to stop and restart your combo for a safer play.
												For defense, when you press the button, you can choose between guarding the enemy attacks if you're standing still, or dodge out of the way if you're moving.
											</p>

											<br /><br />
											<h3>Did It Work?</h3>

											<p>
												For the most part, the control set up worked phenomenally! Everybody that tried the game was able to jump in and enjoy the experience, whether they were young, just starting to play video games,
												or a seasoned player. 
											</p>
											<p>
												However, it wasn't without some gripes. The control scheme did seem a little off for some that were used to other kinds of games, and while many were able to adapt over time,
												some players expressed frustration or questioned the idea to have one button doing all the attacks, or not separating the dodge and block actions to their own respective buttons.
											</p>
											<p>
												Another issue players seemed to struggle with was in understanding which buttons did what on their very first playthrough. While the game itself was polished, played well, and controls worked as they should,
												there was very little the game did to actually teach these controls to the player, leading to many moments where I or another team member had to explain the controls as the player went through the game.
												Personally, while I am a fan of giving players the keys to everything at the start and not hand-holding the player too much, not having any room in-game to explain what buttons did what is definitely an issue.
											</p>

											<br />
											<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

											<p>
												The first improvement should definitely be with some way of explaining the controls to players new to the game, whether that's with a menu explanation, some text in the corner of the game,
												or with a more fleshed out tutorial. Players should be able to start the game and immediately understand what they have access to and how they can use everything to their advantage.
											</p>
											<p>
												For more far reaching features, the game should have settings to change the controls to how players might like them. There should be some presets available to match other games' control layout,
												potentially with re-binding support for people that want a more customized experience. I also do think the issue some players have with the defense buttons
												is a knee-jerk reaction and that they'll get used to it over time (+ it frees up more buttons),
												although I am considering a potential option or keybind setup to split guard and dodge if players are hell-bent on the inclusion.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the future of the project as it relates to controls, Chronostasis does have room to grow and add more to be smushed down to gamepad controls,
												such as guns, skills, power-ups and shortcuts (with potential weapon switching), so I will be keeping a close eye on making sure there's enough content for people to enjoy,
												while still riding that balance between player expression and simple accessibility.

										<!-- Macro Loop -->
										<div>
											<a id="macro"></a>
											<br /><br />

											<details><summary><h2 class="major" style="display:inline-block">2. Macro Gameplay Loop</h2></summary>
												<p>This section goes over the overarching gameplay and features players can experience during the demo.
													Specifically, it will be a look at the wave-based mode.</p>
											<br />

											<h3>Explanation</h3>

											<p>
												For Chronostasis's play session, the general gameplay loop for players is to fight against waves of enemies, likely dying and going to the death world,
												where the player can choose to respawn and try the waves again, or spend a second to relax or practice the game before trying again.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the main gameplay mode, I built out a customizeable system for spawning waves of enemies, where designers could change how many waves there are, which kinds of enemies spawn when, and
												how many spawn on each wave. If you defeat all the enemies on one wave, the game will take a second before spawning the next wave, until there's none left, where the player "wins".
											</p>
											<p>
												When players die to an enemy in the middle of the game, they will be sent to another world where players can freely take a small break, choose to practice the mechanics and controls,
												or walk up to and interact with the object in the center of the room to respawn. When respawning, the player is taken back to the main level and restarts the waves.
											</p>

											<br />
											<h3>Breakdown</h3>

											<p><span class="image left"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="../../images/chrono wave mode.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												For the wave based mode, the first thing I did was draft this structure for customizing waves. You could designate how many total waves there are, and within each one you can
												customize which enemies spawn, how many of them spawn, and potential rewards given to the player upon finishing that wave.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the actual implementation, the wave based functionality was put onto a placeable actor, with a radius around the object to designate the range where enemies could spawn in.
												For the wave-based actor to know if the spawned enemy was killed, it builds an array when each enemy spawns in, binds to each enemy's "OnDeath" dispatcher, and removes that actor from the array.
											</p>
											<p>
												If all are removed, the current wave ends,
												and the next wave begins, spawning the new actors in that wave's list of enemies. The wave then plays certain sound effects or music that might play on that wave,
												either within the actor or from a dispatcher bind on another.
											</p>

											<br />
											<h3>Did It Work?</h3>

											<p>
												On the player side, things worked out really well. People were battling enemies, dying, and coming back to do better in the next game after they learned a bit more about the game.
												The final game has about 5 waves, and between each one

												<p>This section goes over the Chronostasis mechanic, where players have the ability to stop time mid-battle.</p>
											<br />

											<h3>Explanation</h3>

											<p>
												The ultimate ability that the game was named after, and sparked the beginnings of the game.<br />
												Chronostasis is a macro mechanic where players slowly build up Chrono over time, and once their Chrono Gauge is full,
												players are able to activate Chronostasis to pause time for all the enemies and objects in the world, aside from themselves.
											</p>
											<p>
												Chrono is a resource granted to the player by 3 main methods:
												<ul>
													<li>picking up Chrono orbs, obtained by defeating enemies,</li>
													<li>hitting enemies, and</li>
													<li>naturally regenerating, up to a point</li>
												</ul>
												If the designer intends, Chrono can only naturally regenerate up to a certain amount, and players will need to fill the rest up by taking a more active role by hitting or defeating enemies.
												Although even without this, players are still incentivized to get into the action to build up their Chrono Gauge more often
