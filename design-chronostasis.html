									<h3 class="major">Chronostasis</h3>
									<p>Chronostasis is a character action game where you can fight enemies in waves using a scythe and time-stopping powers. <br /><br />
										You can download the game here at <a href="http://chronostasisgame.com">chronostasisgame.com</a>!</p>

										(This game is a WIP. The game as you see it now (and as described below) is running on more custom-built code, but is currently being reworked to support the Gameplay Ability System,
										and fix some underlying quirks to make it easier to develop long-term. Continue reading for more!)<br /><br />
									<br /><br />

									<h3 class="major">Finding Inspiration</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Bayonetta Death Screen.png" alt="" /></span>
										When making Chronostasis, I wanted the combat to play close to a character action game (think Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, etc) 
										where players could fight against enemies, lose some battles, eventually learn how to master the mechanics, come out winning, then finally coming back to style on their foes. 
										Although, a lot of these games tend to have issues with their mechanics. Things like combo meters and grading systems could be rewarding for high end play, 
										though for lower skilled players or for those just getting to grips with the game, it can be a pain to deal with.
									</p>

									<p>
										The game that I think handles these aspects best that I took the most inspiration from, is Kingdom Hearts 2.
										Without going too in-depth, the game has a lot to support both play styles. There's a simpler control scheme with only 1 button to attack,
										which is determined by a combination of what abilities the player has equipped beforehand, how far into the combo they are, and how far away the player is from their enemies.
										Players that are new to the game can equip whatever they want and mash attack, while more experienced players might deliberate over what abilities/items to equip
										and keep track of what attacks they want to trigger.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Enemies also play a more pivitol role over other action games, as the combat is more back-and-forth between player and enemy.
										Enemies might ask the player to defend against them, then the player can exploit their openings for a window to juggle their opponents.
										After a few hits, the enemy will break out of stagger, and the combat loops back around.
										Again, there's a lot more nuance to the combat system that I'm skipping over, but these are the basics that make the gameplay click, and what I wanted to carry over for Chronostasis.
