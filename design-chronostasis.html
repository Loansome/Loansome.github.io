									<h3 class="major">Chronostasis</h3>
									<p>Chronostasis is a character action game where you can fight enemies in waves using a scythe and time-stopping powers. <br /><br />
										You can download the game here at <a href="http://chronostasisgame.com">chronostasisgame.com</a>!</p>

										<br/>
										(This game is a WIP. The game as you see it now (and as described below) is running on more custom-built code, but is currently being reworked to support the Gameplay Ability System,
										and fix some underlying quirks to make it easier to develop long-term. Continue reading for more!)<br /><br />
									<br /><br />


									<h2 class="major">1. Starting Out</h2>
									<br />
									<h4>Finding Inspiration</h4>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Bayonetta Death Screen.png" alt="" />(Bayonetta death screen, punishes you for dying)</span>
										When making Chronostasis, I wanted the combat to play close to a character action game (think Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, etc) 
										where players could fight against enemies, lose some battles, eventually learn how to master the mechanics, come out winning, then finally coming back to style on their foes. 
										Although, a lot of these games tend to have issues with their mechanics. Things like combo meters and grading systems could be rewarding for high end play, 
										though for lower skilled players or for those just getting to grips with the game, it can be a pain to deal with.
									</p>

									<p>
										The game that I think handles these aspects best that I took the most inspiration from, is Kingdom Hearts 2.
										Without going too in-depth, the game has a lot to support both play styles. There's a simpler control scheme with only 1 button to attack,
										which is determined by a combination of what abilities the player has equipped beforehand, how far into the combo they are, and how far away the player is from their enemies.
										Players that are new to the game can equip whatever they want and mash attack, while more experienced players might deliberate over what abilities/items to equip
										and keep track of what attacks they want to trigger.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Enemies also play a more pivitol role over other action games, as the combat is more back-and-forth between player and enemy.
										Enemies might ask the player to defend against them, then the player can exploit their openings for a window to juggle their opponents.
										After a few hits, the enemy will break out of stagger, and the combat loops back around.
										Again, there's a lot more nuance to the combat system that I'm skipping over, but these are the basics that make the gameplay click, and what I wanted to carry over for Chronostasis.
									</p>

									<br />

									<h4>Designing and Creating Chronostasis</h4>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Chronostasis Environment Concept.png" alt="" />(Concept art of the environment)</span>
										Initially, Chronostasis was developed from scratch in a near 1 year time limit. While there's a lot of depth to capture in the game with plans to expand more in the future,
										the deadline that my group and I needed to hit meant we had to pick and choose what to create, stripped down to the essentials. We cut things like extra weapons, attacks, and levels
										in favor of a more streamlined experience where people can play a simpler version of the game, but still with enough there for people to come out saying "This is cool, I want more!"
										While things were cut down, we were still able to get a lot of planned features into the finished build.
									</p>

									<p>
										Our main goals for the smaller-scaled Chronostasis build were to have the controls and combat feel simple yet deep, for players and enemies to have a back and forth with each other,
										for the game to remain engaging for the duration of their play session, and ultimately to give players a taste of the game and envision something greater.
									</p>

									<p>
										For these goals, we settled on having each gameplay role be compressed into their own respective button, and for the main loop to be blocking enemies and punishing their attacks
										before they strike back. While we were unable to make a more complete level with scripted events, the next best thing we could do with our time was to make a wave-based mode
										to encourage a sense of progression and tension building. And if things got too tense for players, they could stop time for a moment of reprieve against the enemy assault and fit in some damage,
										which also serves as a macro-loop resource for players to build up mid-game, as well as selling the vision of Chronostasis as something more unique compared to its rivals.
