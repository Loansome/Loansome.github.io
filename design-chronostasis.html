									<h2 class="major">Chronostasis</h2>
									<p>Chronostasis is a character action game where you can fight enemies in waves using a scythe and time-stopping powers. <br /><br />
										You can download the game here at <a href="http://chronostasisgame.com">chronostasisgame.com</a>!</p>

									<video height="auto" width="100%" controls muted>
										<source src="videos/chronostasis trailer.mp4">
									</video>
										<br/>
										(This game is a WIP. The game as you see it now (and as described below) is running on more custom-built code, but is currently being reworked to support the Gameplay Ability System,
										and fix some underlying quirks to make it easier to develop long-term.)<br /><br />
									<br /><br />


									<h2 class="major">Starting Out (Pre-Production)</h2>
									<br />
									<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Bayonetta Death Screen.png" alt="" />(Bayonetta death screen, punishes you for dying)</span>
										When making Chronostasis, I wanted the combat to play close to a character action game (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, etc) 
										where players start out not knowing the mechanics and losing a few fights here and there, to eventually come out styling on their foes. 
										Although, a lot of these games tend to have issues with their mechanics. Things like combo meters and grading systems could be rewarding for high end play, 
										though for lower skilled players or for those just getting to grips with the game, it can be a pain to deal with.
									</p>

									<p>
										The game that I think handles these aspects best that I took the most inspiration from, is Kingdom Hearts 2.
										The game has a lot to support both play styles, as
										players that are new to the game can equip whatever they want and mash attack, while more experienced players will knowingly keeping track of everything to attack their best.
										Enemies also play a role, asking players to wait for a window to stagger them. After a few hits, the enemy will break out of stagger, and the combat loops back around.
										There's a lot of nuance to the combat system that I'm skipping over, but these are the basics that I wanted to carry over for Chronostasis.
									</p>

									<br />

									<h3>Designing and Creating Chronostasis</h3>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Chronostasis Environment Concept.png" alt="" />(Concept art of the environment)</span>
										Chronostasis as you see it was developed from scratch within a 1 year time limit. While the game has more features planned, the build that you see here is more focused on combat.
										Some features of combat did have to be stripped down, such as extra attacks or weapons, although the core does still exist within this vertical slice.
										Our main goals for the smaller-scaled Chronostasis build were to have the controls and combat feel simple yet deep, for players and enemies to have a back and forth with each other,
										for the game to remain engaging for the duration of their play session, and ultimately to give players a taste of the game before moving to something higher scoped.
									</p>

									<p>
										For these goals, we settled on having each gameplay role be compressed into their own respective button, and for the main loop to be blocking enemies and punishing their attacks.
										While we were unable to make a more complete level with scripted events, the next best thing to make that encouraged a sense of progression and tension building was a wave-based mode.
										And if things got too tense for players, they could stop time for a moment of reprieve against the enemy assault and fit in some damage.
									</p>


									<br /><br />


									<h2 class="major">Feature Breakdowns</h2>
									<br />

									<p>
										This section hosts breakdowns about specific aspects of Chronostasis. These are:

										<ol>
											<li>Control Scheme</li>
											<li>Macro Gameplay Loop (Wave-Based Mode, Death, Chrono Gauge)</li>
											<li>Player Actions/Attacks</li>
											<li>Micro Gameplay Loop (Enemies)</li>
											<li>Targeting</li>
										</ol>
										
										Within each of these, I will talk about:
										</p>
										<p>
										<ul>
											<li>An overview of the design/creation</li>
											<li>In-depth breakdown, likely with some code</li>
											<li>Whether it worked as intended in the final build</li>
											<li>How that aspect could be improved in the future</li>
										</ul>
